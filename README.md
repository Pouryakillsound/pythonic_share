pythonic_share is a sharing system on your router. 

In order to use it go to pythic_share directory and run the following commands:
```bash
pip3 install flask
python3 ./app.py
```

now you'll be given some IPs (Note: all your devices should be connected to one router
or you can connect all your devices to your phone's hotspot and use hotspot as a router).

Chose the on that is not 127.0.0.1 because this IP is only accessible to you computer locally.
